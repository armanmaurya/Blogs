            <H2>Introduction To DC Motor</H2>
            <p>When a machine converts electric energy into mechanical energy, it is called <b>motor</b> </p>
            <p>There are basically two types of motor: alternating-current (ac) motors and direct-current (dc) motors. An ac motor converts alternating (time-vaying) power into mechanical power. When a machine converts time-varying power, it is said to be a dc motor.</p>
            <p>A dc motor can develop starting torque, several order of magniture higher than a comparable size ac motor.</p>
            <p>A motor is extensively used in control systems as a positioning device because its speed as well as its torque can be precisely controlled over a wide range. A dc motor is, of course, a logical choice when a dc power source is easily available.</p>
